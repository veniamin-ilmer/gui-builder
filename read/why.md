## Why..
### Do this at all?
GUI programming is generally considered a *hard* task, especially for a beginner programmer.

Even a seasoned programmer would need to think hard about platform compatibility..

Without some kind of GUI tool, it is difficult to manage the exact positions of all of the widgets on the screen. Managing each object is a hassle in code.

The target audience is a UI designer who wants to quickly build a fast cross-compatible widget-based application.

### Rust?
Rust is a powerful language:

1. Low Level (Fast / Optimized).
2. Easy to use, especially with Higher Order Functions.
3. All garbage collection is done at compile time.
4. Safe Concurrency and Memory Usage.

And personally, this is to expand my knowledge / abilities with Rust.

### Native widgets?
There is a cross-compatible crate [conrod](https://crates.io/crates/conrod) that draws custom widgets, instead of using native libaries.

By drawing custom widgets, the applications appears exactly the same in all operating systems.

I don't like this for two reasons:

1. The look and feel of the application does not play well with the rest of operating system. It feels foreign.
2. Non-native widget drawing libraries require more memory. I want to be able to rival Notepad.exe in memory usage.

### Visual Basic?
Visual Basic was my first language.

Although the language itself is poor, building a GUI was a piece of cake.

I want to integrate a good language - Rust - With easy GUI building from Visual Basic.
