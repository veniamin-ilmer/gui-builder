# GUI Builder
This project should help programmers jumpstart their GUI application programming.

* An easy to use platform where you can click and drag, resize, and reconfigure widgets on a window.
* The platform should be able to build into Rust code, using any widget based Crate. (winapi, gtk, etc)
* This starting Rust code should provide example event handling functionality to the user from each Crate.
